This is a python project where we are creating a volume control system using hand-gestures

We require python libraries like open-cv, mediapipe and pyautogui
Open-cv, also called Open Source Computer Vision Library is the most basic library we need when it comes to image and video processing. It performs various tasks like reading an image, resizing the image, performing blurred effect on the image and also helps in drawing different shapes and texts.

Mediapipe is a very important library when it comes to facial recognition, hand recognition and object detection. In this project, it is used for hand gesture recognition as it can detect hands and their keypoints as an image.

Pyautogui is a python library that helps in making the user interaction with computer system easy because it provides features like taking a screenshot, provide keyboard input and mouse interation.
